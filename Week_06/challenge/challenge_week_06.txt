Background:

Imagine you work for a smartphone dealer and are asked to analyze the recent market for smartphones. 
Your task is to gain insights into the pricing by examining a dataset containing information 
on various smartphone models, their prices, and brands. To help the company make informed decisions, 
you need to determine the average price per brand. This analysis will provide valuable insights into 
which brands tend to retain their value and how pricing varies across different manufacturers. As an
experienced Data Analyst you decide to use AI-support to analyse the data.
 
1.) The data are provided in the file 'smartphone_data.csv' in the data folder.

2.) One challenge with this data is, that it is mostly raw data. The price, for example, has the format 'CHF 2518.-'.
    This means that the numerical values of the prices for each smartphone must be extracted before they can be analyzed.

3.) You use an LLM that provides Python code in a Jupyter Notebook to automate price extraction and data analysis.

4.) The output must be a graphic showing the average price per brand in a bar chart.
